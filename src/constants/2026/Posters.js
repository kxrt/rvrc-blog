    presenters: [
      "Lee Jing Min",

    abstract: "While Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice critiques the limited agency of women in a patriarchal society, Joe Wright’s Pride & Prejudice (2005) modernises Elizabeth Bennet’s autonomy by highlighting emotional expression and personal freedom as feminist resistance against social constraints. In contrast to Austen’s use of irony and rationality to critique patriarchal structures, the film shifts its focus to Elizabeth’s emotional interiority. This repositioning aligns with cinematic approaches that foreground female subjectivity, casting emotional expressiveness as a strategy of agency that resists objectification and reclaims narrative control. The paper examines this reframing through feminist film theory, showing how the film both empowers Elizabeth through emotional autonomy and romanticises wealth and propriety, creating tension with Austen’s sharper critique of class and patriarchy.",

    abstract: "Alice Lee Plaza was envisioned as a central commons connecting NUS’s cultural institutions, yet its everyday use tells a quieter story. Rather than a place to gather, its usage is mostly transient, often merely a space to pass through. Through site observations and student interviews, this project reflects on the disconnect between the plaza’s design intentions and student rhythms of campus life. In response, it explores targeted, student-centric interventions that encourage intentional lingering, interaction and informal use, reimagining the plaza as a lively, meaningful, and culturally resonant campus space.",

Our project seeks to address the untapped potential and accessibility challenges of this critical campus transport. We propose a redesign prioritizing inclusivity, multifunctionality and solving current issues with the place. Our proposal integrates sustainable porous concrete paths, widened shared lanes for cyclists, improved lighting for nighttime conditions and educational zones such as a seed library and butterfly garden. This vision transforms the area into a vibrant community hub for research, study, and leisure, fostering social interaction and offering students a unique, accessible alternative for work and play.",

    abstract: "In this project, our objective was to explore how traditional hawker culture is continuously shaped and transformed by forces such as modernisation and external cultural influences arising from globalisation. To achieve this, we hosted an interactive tour at Timbre+, where participants were immersed in a contemporary hawker setting, providing an opportunity to sample a diverse range of cuisines that reflect both local heritage and global influences. In addition, participants engaged directly with stall owners, gaining deeper insights into the origins, adaptations, and unique characteristics of each cuisine, as well as the challenges and opportunities faced by modern hawkers.",

In RVC1000, POV: A Singaporean working in Spain, we centered our project on a first-person perspective video highlighting culture differences a Singaporean may face as they navigate through Spain’s working culture. Paired together with an interactive workshop where participants are guided through on what they might do when they are placed in such situations, this project serves to conceptualize the different cultural dimensions of Spain in the workplace setting, contrasting it to Singapore’s and ultimately, provide a framework to develop viable strategies to better assimilate a Singaporean into diverse workplace cultures.",

Though the RVC1001 course, we explored the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and Singapore's progress on them.  Therefore, in relation to SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, we looked deeper into the challenges faced by these women in Singapore. Our poster consolidates information explaining the forms of abuse faced by foreign domestic workers in Singapore and provides resources for bystanders to provide support.",

We engaged directly with community organisations in Johor, Kuala Lumpur, and Penang. Our team documented how youths cultivate skills in leadership while working alongside elders, educators, and practitioners. Through field visits, interviews and on-site observations across coastal villages, urban campuses, and mangrove conservation sites, we explored how cultural contexts shape youths’ motivations, challenges, and approaches to sustainability. The project demonstrates how experiential learning bridges theory and practice, enabling youths to become active custodians of cultural and environmental heritage while navigating modern pressures.",

For our fellow NUS peers with dyslexia, their everyday experiences with group projects, revision and exams are notably different and are oftentimes overlooked because their condition is invisible. Beyond shedding light on their experiences and raising them to public consciousness, our project also hopes to share useful strategies and tips that everybody can implement in order to foster a more empathetic and inclusive learning environment that welcomes and uplifts all.",
