    abstract:
      "Workplace cultures vary across different countries around the world. Although workplace cultures between certain countries can be quite similar, there are often nuances between them. An example is the comparison between the workplace cultures of Singapore and Hong Kong. Given Hong Kong’s status as one of Singapore's key trading partners and investors, we would have plenty of opportunities to interact with people from Hong Kong in a business setting. Hence, understanding the workplace culture of Hong Kong as well as identifying the subtle differences from the workplace culture of Singapore will be vital and of relevance to us. Feng Shui culture is one such practice that can be observed in both. Thus, our group decided to research on how the Feng Shui culture can vary across 2 cultures that shares many similarities.",

    abstract:
      "As part of the RVC2000 course, thirty students and three lecturers embarked on a journey across West Malaysia where they visited different partners across multiple states to understand how the community interacts with nature and the need for localised sustainable development. One such partner is Dorani homestay where guests were exposed to cultural activities such as their traditional dance and making of roti cenai. The study trip allowed for the real-world application of concepts taught in the classroom and exposes participants to the opportunities and challenges in the pursuit of sustainable development. ",

    title: "Small Steps: Nudging the Recycling Mindset",
    course: "RVN2000",
    presenters: ["Basil Tan Song Sze, Wang Yuting"],
    abstract:
      "How can we foster a more resource-conscious community in NUS? Through coursework and interactions with NUS Zero Waste, “Heartware” was identified as a significant hurdle in answering this question. Therefore, our RVN project reviews the existing landscape and identifies opportunities to nudge behavioural changes concerning recycling habits. Focusing on the RVRC community, our solution adopts a contextualised approach with practical implementation, hoping that these small steps would make a bigger difference in cultivating a resource-conscious community.",

    title: "Rewilding & Conservation: Admiralty Park​",
    course: "RVN2001",
    presenters: ["Pan Yongjing"],
    abstract:
      "This project aims to transform Admiralty Park from a fragmented urban park into a biodiverse, accessible green space via a detailed and well-researched rewilding strategy, bringing benefits for both wildlife and the community. The strategy involves careful selection of tree species, risk-aversion and maintenance strategies to transform a relatively barren green space into a thriving Lowland Mixed Dipterocarp Forest. Students of nearby schools and the public residing in the neighbourhood may be engaged and educated by experts from RVRC, NParks and NSS to contribute to rewilding and plot & fauna monitoring efforts, enriching both nature and community.",

    title: "Conservation Conversation - We Can Do Better",
    course: "RVN2002",
    presenters: ["He Xinghua, Ng Jing Yi Hannah, Tania Ho Kaye Wee"],
    abstract:
      "Before this module, many felt disconnected from nature due to limited interaction with nature. This course bridges the disconnect by combining theoretical knowledge with firsthand experiences in Malaysia’s lush forests. Over the 10-day trip, attitudes toward wildlife shift, as close encounters spark newfound appreciation, replacing the initial fear and apathy. Given the scale of conservation challenges, interdisciplinary collaboration is needed. Many might be intimidated by the seemingly high barrier of entry to conservation, but our conclusion is that individuals from all fields can contribute meaningfully to conservation efforts, bringing diverse perspectives and creative solutions.",

    abstract:
      "With Singapore’s growing population and the nation significantly affected by the high uncertainty in geopolitics and climate conditions, food has become an asset in ensuring the nation's development and growth. In our project, we strive to recognize the concept of the “3 Food Baskets” initiated by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) while acknowledging the agency’s “30-by-30” goal, which aims to achieve 30% of Singapore’s nutritional needs by 2030. Furthermore, local production only makes up less than 10% of the nation’s food needs as of 2020. Hence, we hope that this project will create awareness among participants regarding local production and encourage them to make informed decisions in the future.",

    presenters: ["See Rui Ting Rachel"],
    abstract:
      "Climate change is a global crisis demanding immediate attention. However, its communication often fails to engage the general public due to its complex terminology. Most definitions of climate concepts are also ladened with scientific jargon, further impairing non-experts’ ability to recognise the severity of the situation. In light of this issue, Minimal English presents a viable solution. As a highly reduced version of English that supports cross-translatability, it works to elucidate ideas and ensures that crucial information reaches a greater population. By transcending linguistic and cultural barriers, Minimal English paves the way towards inclusive climate action.",

    course: "RVX1003",
    presenters: ["Hazel Yew Jintong"],
    abstract:
      'The cinematic adaptation of "Kim Ji-young: Born 1982" delves into the pervasive gender inequalities entrenched in South Korean society, emphasising their psychological toll on women. By exploring Ji-young’s journey through childhood, marriage, and motherhood, the film highlights structural oppression, rigid gender roles, and patriarchal hierarchies that constrain women\'s lives. Drawing on feminist theory, this paper examines societal norms perpetuating these inequalities, from workplace discrimination to domestic expectations. Through a detailed analysis of key scenes, it underscores the urgency for societal transformation, fostering feminist consciousness, and advocating for gender equity.',
