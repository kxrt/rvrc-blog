            The Ridge View Residential College (RVRC) marks its 10th Anniversary
            in 2024, with a nod to its forward-looking mission of fostering
            sustainability education and workplace readiness in young adults.
            This yearâ€™s symposium celebrates how learning at the college
            transcends the confines of the classroom and the immediacy of the
            present, towards a contribution to the future of our society and the
            environment.
