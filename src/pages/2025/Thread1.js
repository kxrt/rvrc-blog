            Focused on academic learning at RVRC, presentations in this thread
            demonstrated how the RVRC Programme's courses enable students to
            hone their skills in navigating a dynamic and increasingly complex
            world. The thread also featured experiential learning beyond the
            classroom, such as partnering with external organizations,
            empowering students to identify real-world issues and effect
            meaningful change. Students showcased the learning process and
            successful application of skills like critical thinking and creative
            problem-solving.
