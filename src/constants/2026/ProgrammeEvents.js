We propose that a collaboration with RVRC represents an excellent opportunity for both Fashion Parade as well as the college. A clothes swap event hosted in RVRC with the help of Fashion Parade would both help students declutter, find new pieces of clothing, as well as promote sustainable fashion to a wider audience.",

Drawing on experiential learning from the RVN2002 module, we engaged in ecotourism activities such as hiking in Taman Negara National Park, exploring Guasik Naga Cave, and birdwatching at Fraser’s Hill. These firsthand experiences revealed how poorly managed or irresponsible ecotourism can harm fragile ecosystems despite its conservation-oriented intent. In response, our project outlines accessible guidelines for responsible ecotourism, emphasising low-impact practices, respect for wildlife, and adherence to park regulations. Our guide highlights the role of eco-tourists in supporting sustainable conservation and protecting natural environments for future generations.",

This presentation showcases our project: Innovation in Action, a collaboration with MINDS to design, test, and refine inclusive programmes for persons with moderate intellectual disabilities. Working with clients ranging from young adults to elderly individuals, each with diverse abilities, communication styles, and mobility needs, we supported vocational tasks such as packing headphones for Singapore Airlines. Through hands-on observation, facilitation, and iteration, we streamlined work processes while reflecting on ethical considerations, challenges, and meaningful learning moments.",

As youths represent the next generation of sustainability leaders, our group sought to explore how educational institutions in East Malaysia are integrating sustainability into their curricula and public outreach efforts. From engagement sessions conducted by the WWF to practical training for aspiring marine biologists at the Borneo Marine Research Institute, this project examines how institutions equip their students with sustainability education through practical, real-world experiences.",

    abstract: "Workplace cultures vary across different countries around the world. While some cultures may appear similar, subtle differences often influence professional interactions. One such example is the comparison between Singaporean and Korean workplace cultures. As South Korea is a major economic and business partner in Asia, there are increasing opportunities to collaborate with Korean professionals. Understanding Korean workplace culture and recognising how it differs from Singapore’s is both relevant and important to ensure successful collaboration. Jeong culture, a uniquely Korean concept emphasising emotional bonds, loyalty, and long-term relationships, plays a significant role in workplace dynamics. Our group aims to explore how Jeong culture shapes professional relationships in Korea.",

    abstract: "This study examines the Confucian moral value chǐ, often translated as “shame,” and argues that such renderings risk angiocentric distortion. Drawing on classical Confucian texts across dynasties and a survey of 18 native Chinese speakers, the study analyses the enduring components of chǐ. Using the Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM), it explicates chǐ as a moral value centred on reflection and behavioural correction, mediated by guilt, responsibility, and reputation. The findings show that chǐ functions as an active, transformative ethical mechanism rather than a passive emotion.",

    abstract: "This presentation revisits my CA2 pitch and CA3 final critique for RVX1003, focusing on Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer (2023) through the lens of the director’s signature style. I analyse how non-linear storytelling, subjective cinematography, and immersive sound design shape the film’s “Great Man” narrative and convey Oppenheimer’s inner conflict. By closely examining scenes such as the Trinity Test, victory speech, and security hearing, the project explores how cinematic form influences meaning. Reflecting on the module, watching the film in class and learning specific filming techniques changed how I approach cinema, allowing me to interpret films more thoughtfully and appreciate the deliberate craft behind what I watch.",

Informed heavily by insights gained from course field trips, our group re-envisions Lover’s Park as a vibrant and inclusive campus hub. Paying homage to the Central Library Building (CLB) as NUS’s former civic and intellectual centre, the proposal seeks to reinject social and spatial vitality into the site. The redesigned space integrates spaces for faculty, students, and visitors, drawing from our observations during field trips. This fosters interaction, accessibility, and long-term social sustainability.",

The course challenged assumptions shaped by dominant narratives of multiculturalism and meritocracy, pushing us to confront the gap between policy ideals and lived realities. Through a cultural immersion project on the Kristang community, we learned how smaller ethnic groups face cultural erosion not through overt discrimination, but structural neglect under the CMIO framework. This experience highlighted that racial harmony does not guarantee cultural equity. Overall, RVSS1004 deepened our awareness of race as a structural issue and strengthened our commitment to empathy, inclusion, and informed dialogue in a diverse society.",
