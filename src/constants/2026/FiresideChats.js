      "RV Learning Forest is a green space dedicated to educating, inspiring, and enhancing the biological connectivity of our College in Nature. Accessible to all, this outdoor classroom features a diverse collection of native plants, inviting visitors to explore and deepen their understanding of local biodiversity. These native species do not only attract pollinators, but also establish an ecological link to the Kent Ridge Forest.\nThe forest is a community-driven initiative, with residents participating in its creation and ongoing upkeep. Our Learning Forest thus stands as a nurturing ground for environmental stewardship—a place where education, collaboration, and placemaking converge.",

    biography:
      "RV FoRestore is an interest group that focuses on forest restoration. Besides tree plantings, our activities focus on caring for our trees at our plots at Chestnut Nature Park. This includes seedling salvage, tree monitoring and tagging, Seedling Protection Activity (SPA), and the annual Forest Restoration Workshop. We also hold nursery sessions at our nursery right behind the dining hall, where we take care of our seedlings before they're big enough to be planted out!",
